## Giving thanks!
Thank you to the contributors of [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) for supplying a proxy solution to be able to pull data from an html website. Before finding this solution and deploying, I was facing cors errors when trying to fetch data from resources. This codebase allowed me to deploy a reverse-proxy and allow for me to get these resources needed.
